    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Try this matcha frappé for a creamy, delicious drink that rivals the ones you'd get at that well-known coffee chain. I use DōMatcha green tea powder as it's the best quality around. It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>5 ice cubes, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla-flavored syrup (such as Torani®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon matcha green tea powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whipped cream, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend milk, ice, vanilla syrup, and green tea powder in a blender to desired consistency. Serve with whipped cream on top.</li>
        <li>By increasing or decreasing the amount of ice, you can adjust the thickness of the frappé. You can also adjust the amount of matcha and vanilla syrup to your preference.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>You can substitute almond milk, rice milk, or soy milk for the milk. Don't use the contents of green tea bags as a substitution for the matcha powder, though. It's not the same thing and has a whole different taste.</em></p>
